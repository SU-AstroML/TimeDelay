# TimeDelay
Final project for the AstroML course, based on data from TDC1
Page of the challeng, including data:
http://timedelaychallenge.org/


# Data format

Columns in 'x = load("pairs_with_truths_and_windows.npz")['arr_0']':


  * From the original light curve pair files: 
    * time - 
    * lcA - 
    * errA - 
    * lcB - 
    * errB - 

  * From the path of the light curve pair files
    * tdc - numerical part of tdc directory name
    * rung - numerical part of rung directory name
    * pair - numerical part of pair filename. Note: pairs in quad
      systems (A, B) have 0.0 added for A and 0.5 added for B.

  * From the corresponding truth file (duplicated for all rows in the corresponding light curve)
    * dt - 
    * m1 - 
    * m2 - 
    * zl - 
    * zs - 
    * id - 
    * tau - 
    * sig - 

  * Computed values
    * full_pair_id - a (globally) unique id for each combination of tdc, rung, pair
    * window_id - a (globally) unique id for each sample window in the light curves


# Scripts

## convert_to_npz.py
* Input: tdc0/*, tdc1/*
* Output: TimeDelayData/pairs_with_truths.npz

Loads all the data into one large numpy array, merging the ground
truth and the source data and adding a column with a globally unique
id for each light curve pair.


## amend_sampling.py
* Input: TimeDelayData/pairs_with_truths.npz
* Output: TimeDelayData/pairs_with_truths_and_windows.npz

Calculates the sampling window boundaries and assigns a globally
unique id to each sampling window. This is done by comparing the
interval between two consecutive points with the average interval
between two such points.


## GP.py
* Input: TimeDelayData/pairs_with_truths_and_windows.npz
* Output: GPModels/*

Trains a Gaussian Process model for each light curve in each sampling
window, and serializes the model using pickle.


## gp_resample.py
* Input: TimeDelayData/pairs_with_truths_and_windows.npz, GPModels/*
* Output: TimeDelayData/gp_resampled_of_windows_with_truth.npz

Interpolates evenly sampled data for each light curve in each window,
using the trained Gaussian Process models from GP.py


## Timeshift.py

* Input: TimeDelayData/gp_resampled_of_windows_with_truth.npz
* Output: timeshift_{correlate,ng_correlate,mse}_normalized[_detrend].npz

Compares the two light corves at all possible offsets using different
methods. The light curves can optionally be detrended before
comparison.

## measure_window_corelations.py
* Input: timeshift_{correlate,ng_correlate,mse}_normalized[_detrend].npz
* Output: timeshift_{correlate,ng_correlate,mse}_normalized[_detrend].measures.npz

Finds the maximum correlation and records its magnitude and offset for each window.

## sum_pair_corelation_measures.py
* Input: timeshift_{correlate,ng_correlate,mse}_normalized[_detrend].measures.npz
* Output: timeshift_{correlate,ng_correlate,mse}_normalized[_detrend].measures.pairsums.npz

Calculates the mean, median and stddev of the maximum correlation
offsets of all windows for a light curve pair.
